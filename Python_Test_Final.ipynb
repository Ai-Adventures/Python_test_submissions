        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You are working on a large-scale software project involving thousands of different Python files. The files have been written by different programmers and the naming of functions is somewhat inconsistent. You receive a new directive stating that the function names all have to be in camel case. In camel case, function names consisting of multiple words have a capital letter in each word and most underscores are removed. For instance, `def MyArithmeticCalculator()` is in camel case but `def my_arithmetic_calculator()` is not in camel case.\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to write a Python program that automatically processes Python code and renames the function names instead of doing it by hand. The instruction states that:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1.) All functions names need to be changed to camel case. E.g. a function\n",
        "  `calculate_speed_of_vehicle()` needs to be renamed to `CalculateSpeedOfVehicle()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.) If the function has one or more leading ’_’ (underscores) they need to be preserved.\n",

        "  All other underscores need to be removed. E.g. a function `__calc_size()` is renamed to `__CalcSize()`.\n",

        "  3.) If the function is already in camel case, you do not need to change it but it still needs to appear in the dictionary d specified below.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4.) You can assume that there will be no name clashes. That is, a given function name which is not in camel case will not already appear in camel case elsewhere. E.g.if there is a function `print_all_strings()` then there is no function `PrintAllStrings()` elsewhere in the code.\n",
